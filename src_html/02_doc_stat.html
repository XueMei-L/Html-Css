        HTML4
        XHTML2.0
        HTML5
        ...
    There are many versions of the web page, but we are using HTML5
    so when we write html, we must let the web page know that we are using HTML5
    
    How?
    Add <!doctype html>
    There are many ways to write, like:
    <!doctype HTML>
    <!Doctype html>

    Where i need to add (<!doctype html>)
    The frist line of html
