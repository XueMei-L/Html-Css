    # Character Encoding
        The process of Character Encoding:
        linxueme -> 101011000110  (process of coding)
        101011000110 -> linxuemei (process of decoding)

        All data is stored in binary form when stored in the computer
        and the text is also.

    # Coding
        The process of converting character into binary codes is called Encoding
    
    # Decoding 
        The process of converting binary codes into character is called decoding

    # Character set
        The rules used for encoding and decoding become the character set

    # Garbled problem
        If the character serts used for encoding and decoding are different
        garbled characters will occur.
    
    # Common character set
        ASCII
        ISO88591
        GB2312
        GBK
        UTF-8 The character set we used during development were all UTF-8

    # How to aplicate in html
        use <meta charset="UTF-8"> to specify character set that we wanna use.
