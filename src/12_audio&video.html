    # Audio
        Use "audio" to import an external audio file

    # Attributes:
        controls -> Whether to allow users to control playback
        autoplay -> Auto play of audio files
                    If autoplay is not set, the audio will automatically play when opening the web page
                    Most web pages will not automatically play music
        loop -> Infinite loop

    # Video
        Use "video" to import an external video file

    # Recomendation
        In development, local audio and video are generally not used, because a larger bandwidth is required to ensure normal playback.
        Generally buy third-party video or audio
