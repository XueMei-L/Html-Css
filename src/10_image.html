    # Image
    The imagen tag is only used to introduce an external image
    use "img" to introduce a image (it is a self-closing tag)
    "src="" " is the path of the image
    img is a Replacement element

    # Description of a image
    use "alt=" to describe a image
    Search engines identify pictures/images based on the content of alt

    # width and height (unit px)
    Redefine the picture size
    If you only change the height or width, it will scale proportionally

    # Recomendation
    PC:
    It is not recommended to modify the image size
    Amplification is easy to be distorted
    Reduce memory consumption
    Mobile:
    Will often reduce the big picture to ensure clarity
